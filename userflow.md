# Advonex User Flow

## Overview
Advonex is a platform connecting clients with legal professionals. The application supports two primary user types: Clients and Lawyers.

## User Types
1. **Clients** - Users seeking legal services
2. **Lawyers** - Legal professionals offering services

## Current Implementation

### 1. General User Flow

#### Landing Page
- Users arrive at the home page (`/`)
- The landing page displays:
  - Hero section with a call-to-action to search for lawyers
  - Practice areas section showcasing different legal specialties
- Navigation options:
  - Header with links to main sections
  - Bottom navigation on mobile devices

#### Registration
- Users can register as either a client or lawyer
- Form collects: name, email, password, and account type
- Lawyer registration has an extended flow with additional professional information

### 2. Client User Flow

#### Finding Lawyers
- Clients can search for lawyers from:
  - The home page CTA button
  - The search page (`/client/lawyers`)
- On the lawyers directory page, clients can:
  - Search by name or practice area
  - Filter by location
  - Browse lawyer cards showing:
    - Profile photo
    - Name
    - Location
    - Practice areas
    - Rating and experience

#### Lawyer Profile
- Clients can view detailed lawyer profiles (`/client/lawyers/[id]`)
- Profile includes:
  - Professional photo
  - Name and location
  - Practice areas
  - Rating and reviews
  - Contact information
  - Professional bio
  - Education history
  - Client reviews

### 3. Lawyer User Flow

#### Registration
- Extended registration process for lawyers
- Basic information collected in initial registration
- Professional details collected in second step

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Database Schema
- User model with role-based differentiation (CLIENT/LAWYER)
- Separate profile models for clients (userProfile) and lawyers (lawyerProfile)
- Specializations linked to lawyer profiles through a many-to-many relationship

### UI Components
- Responsive design with mobile-specific navigation
- Card-based UI for lawyer listings
- Form components for user input
- Theme support (light/dark mode)

### Navigation Structure
- Home (`/`)
- Client landing (`/client`)
- Lawyer search (`/client/lawyers`)
- Lawyer profile (`/client/lawyers/[id]`)
- Registration (`/register`)
- Lawyer registration (`/register/lawyer`)

## Planned Future Functionality

### Authentication
- **Login** functionality (with just email for now) for returning users
- **Logout** functionality
- persist user session
- UI updates to reflect logged-in state(maybe just a logout button and user name instead of signup/signin button)
- Session management and protected routes(for client and lawyers just with email for now, not any token or auth id)

### Client Features
- view lawyer profiles from databse instead of mockdata right now
- 

### Lawyer Features
- signup and login with persistance
- register form updates data to database
- show dashboard(after successful register when clicked on his username button in header) with all the lawyer's data from database

### Tech info
- use local storage, state, context or react query, whichever appropriate for persistance
- no state management library like redux or mobx to be used
- keep prisma schema as sigle source of truth for all data throughout the project as far as possible(use types generated by prisma as far as possible, instead of seperate type interfaces, create interfaces if needed for types not covered by prisma).
